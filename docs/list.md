| Architecture -        | It involves detailing the simplistic view of the JavaScript Application Architecture. It is very effective for solving complex problems as it implements either MVC or MVVM pattern to the application.                                                                                                                        |  
| Building blocks       | A Building Block is a package of functionality defined to meet the business needs across an organization. A Building Block has published interfaces to access the functionality. A Building Block may interoperate with other, interdependent, Building Blocks.                                                                |  
| Data binding          | In simple words, you can say that data binding is a communication between your typescript code of your component and your template which user sees. It makes easy to define interactive applications without worrying about pushing and pulling data. Data binding can be either one-way data binding or two-way data binding. |
| Extension             | An extension adds features and functions to a browser. It's created using familiar web-based technologies — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It can take advantage of the same web APIs as JavaScript on a web page, but an extension also has access to its own set of JavaScript APIs                                              |  
| Memory usage          | reading or writing the value of a variable or an object property or even passing an argument to a function.And how much cpu memory is consumed by the app, also how much memory leakages                                                                                                                                       |  
| Routing               | Routing is the act of matching a request to a given controller. Typically, routing will examine the request URI, and attempt to match the URI path segment against provided constraints. If the constraints match, a set of "matches" are returned, one of which should be the controller name to execute.                     |  
| Hooks                 | Hooks are JavaScript functions that manage the state's behaviour and side effects by isolating them from a component.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |  
| cross platform        | Cross-platform app frameworks are the tools used by the developers to create apps for multiple frameworks. Unlike native, cross-platform frameworks allow developers to develop an app with one-time coding and run it on all platforms such as Android, iOS, Windows, with a few minor changes in the development of course.  |
| dependency injection  | dependency injection is a design pattern in which an object or function receives other objects or functions that it depends on. A form of inversion of control, dependency injection aims to separate the concerns of constructing objects and using them, leading to loosely coupled programs.                                |  
| Directives            | Directives are markers on the DOM element which tell AngularJS to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element or even transform the DOM element with its children. Simple AngularJS allows extending HTML with new attributes called Directives.                                                                           |  
| CLI                   | Command Line Input CLI is a command line program that accepts text input to execute operating system functions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |  
| Code splitting        | Code splitting is the splitting of code into various bundles or components which can then be loaded on demand or in parallel. As an application grows in complexity or is maintained, CSS and JavaScripts files or bundles grow in byte size, especially as the number and size of included third-party libraries increases    |  
| Accessibility         | Web accessibility (also referred to as a11y) is the design and creation of websites that can be used by everyone. Accessibility support is necessary to allow assistive technology to interpret web pages.                                                                                                                     |  
| State                 | A state is a JavaScript object that stores the dynamic data of a component and allows it to follow changes between renderings. It's a combination of all those different states. For instance, if the user is not authenticated, is the modal open                                                                             |  
| Template              | templates are pre-designed layouts that allow you to arrange content onto a webpage to create a simple yet well-designed website.                                                                                                                                                                                              |  
| Rendering             | Rendering in programming refers to processing any piece of code that we have written and showing the result of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |  
| License               | a document that provides legally binding guidelines for the use and distribution of software                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |  
| Deep linking          | deep linking is a technology that launches an app and opens a specific page once a user clicks a URL on a web page or in another app. Implementing deep links is a sure way to optimize user experience and increase your conversion rates.                                                                                    |  
| Browser compatibility | The term browser compatibility refers to the ability of a certain website to appear fully functional on different browsers that are available in the market. This means that the website's HTML coding, as well as the scripts on that website, should be compatible to run on the browsers.                                   |  
| Model                 | Modern JavaScript frameworks use a software design pattern called Model–View–Controller. It is commonly used for developing user interfaces that divide related programming logic into three interconnected elements. The model is the central web component of the pattern as it is the application's dynamic data structure. |
| Modules               | modules allow you to break up your code into separate files. This makes it easier to maintain the code-base.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |  
| Component             | Web Components is a suite of different technologies allowing you to create reusable custom elements — with their functionality encapsulated away from the rest of your code — and utilize them in your web apps.                                                                                                               |  
| Modern js / Babel     | Babel is a JavaScript compiler Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments.                                                                                                                      |  
| Computed properties   | computed properties enable you to create a property that can be used to modify, manipulate, and display data within your components in a readable and efficient manner. You can use computed properties to calculate and display values based on a value or set of values in the data model.                                   |  
| DOM                   | The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page                                  |  
| Views                 | In the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, the view handles the app's data presentation and user interaction. It displays the information from the model to the user.                                                                                                                                                         |
