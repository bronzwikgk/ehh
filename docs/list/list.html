                <td>
                    In simple words, you can say that data binding is a 
communication between your typescript code of your
 component and your template which user sees. 
It makes easy to define interactive applications 
without worrying about pushing and pulling data. 
Data binding can be either one-way data binding 
or two-way data binding.

It's created using familiar web-based technologies —
 HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It can take advantage of

an extension also has access to its own set of 
JavaScript APIs

                <td>
                    Routing is the act of matching a request to a given controller. 
Typically, routing will examine the request URI, and attempt 
to match the URI path segment against provided constraints. 
If the constraints match, a set of "matches" are returned, 
one of which should be the controller name to execute.

                <td>
                    Cross-platform app frameworks are the tools used
 by the developers to create apps for multiple frameworks. 
Unlike native, cross-platform frameworks allow developers 
to develop an app with one-time coding and run it on all 
platforms such as Android, iOS, Windows, with a few minor 
changes in the development of course.

                <td>
                    dependency injection is a design pattern in which an 
object or function receives other objects or functions 
that it depends on. A form of inversion of control, 
dependency injection aims to separate the concerns 
of constructing objects and using them, leading to 
loosely coupled programs.

                    Directives are markers on the DOM element which 
tell AngularJS to attach a specified behavior to that 
DOM element or even transform the DOM element 
with its children. Simple AngularJS allows extending 
HTML with new attributes called Directives.

                <td>
                    Code splitting is the splitting of code into various 
bundles or components which can then be loaded 
on demand or in parallel. As an application grows 
in complexity or is maintained, CSS and JavaScripts 
files or bundles grow in byte size, especially as the 
number and size of included third-party libraries increases

                    A state is a JavaScript object that stores the dynamic 
data of a component and allows it to follow changes 
between renderings. It's a combination of all those 
different states. For instance, if the user is not 
authenticated, is the modal open

                    Modern JavaScript frameworks use a software 
design pattern called Model–View–Controller. 
It is commonly used for developing user interfaces 
that divide related programming logic into three 
interconnected elements. The model is the central 
web component of the pattern as it is the application's 
dynamic data structure.
