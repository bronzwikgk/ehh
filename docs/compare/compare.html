                    value (not necessarily the initial state) and

                    There is no difference between a view or
                    component in the Vue.js project. It’s more
                    of a folder structure that means a Vue
                    views component is a page, while a
                    component refers to something that is
                    reusable and can be used in a view.

                    Any event that is triggered on a model in
                    a collection will also be triggered on the
                    collection directly, for convenience.
                    This allows you to listen for changes to
                    specific attributes in any model in a
                    collection, for example:
                    documents.on("change:selected", ...)
                </td>
                <td></td>
                <td></td>
                <td></td>
                <td></td>
                <td></td>
